Official requirements: 

1. When I'm given a first name, a last name and an optional language, it should generate formal and informal greetings that I could use throughout my app.

2. It should support both English and Spanish languages for starters.

3. It should be reusable, meaning that it won't interfere with any of the other JavaScript code in my app, and someone else can just grab it and use it in their apps.


3. And lastly, we should have an easy to type structure, kind of jQuery like, something like G$.

4. greetr should also support jQuery. So even though it returns greetings what we'd like is to be able to give it a jQuery object that points at some HTML element. And it'll fill that element with the greeting.
